# Cursor Rules for Neon Dogfight Project

## Testing
- Do NOT perform browser testing unless explicitly requested by the user
- Skip automatic testing after making changes

## Version Control
- Do NOT commit changes unless explicitly requested by the user
- When user says "commit", ALWAYS commit AND push (not just commit)
- Stage changes and show status when work is complete, but wait for user approval to commit

## Workflow
1. Make requested changes
2. Run linter checks if files were modified
3. Inform user of changes made
4. Wait for user to request commit (which means commit + push)
