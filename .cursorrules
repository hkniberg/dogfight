# Cursor Rules for Neon Dogfight Project

## Testing
- Do NOT perform browser testing unless explicitly requested by the user
- Skip automatic testing after making changes

## Browser Testing Server
- When browser testing is needed, check if HTTP server is already running on port 3000
- Use: `ps aux | grep "python3 -m http.server 3000" | grep -v grep`
- If not running, start ONE persistent server in background: `python3 -m http.server 3000 > /dev/null 2>&1 &`
- Do NOT kill and restart the server unnecessarily - keep it running
- Server should remain running at http://localhost:3000 throughout the session

## Version Control
- Do NOT commit changes unless explicitly requested by the user
- When user says "commit", ALWAYS commit AND push (not just commit)
- Stage changes and show status when work is complete, but wait for user approval to commit

## Workflow
1. Make requested changes
2. Run linter checks if files were modified
3. Inform user of changes made
4. Wait for user to request commit (which means commit + push)
